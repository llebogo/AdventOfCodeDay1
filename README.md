This is my Advent of Code solutions.

Most of my solutions are done in python 3.9 and Java 11 as these are the languages i use.

My aim is to complete and find different ways of solving these puzzles, not to be first on the leaderboard. I aim to have fun solving the coding puzzles and playing with the concepts, and I try to include explanations of my thinking in the code. Sometimes they wont be too clear but i will try my best.

Thank You!
